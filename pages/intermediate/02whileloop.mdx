# While Loops: While true, keep looping! ðŸŽ¶
While loops are another type of loop in Java that allow us to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. Here's an example:

```java
int i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println("I am loop #" + i);
  i++;
}
```

In this example, we're initializing `i` to 0, and then using a while loop to repeat the block of code as long as `i` is less than 5. Inside the loop, we're printing out a message that includes the current value of `i`, and then incrementing `i` by 1. The output of this code will be:

```
I am loop #0
I am loop #1
I am loop #2
I am loop #3
I am loop #4
```

ðŸŽ¬ In the movie "The Matrix," the character Morpheus famously says 
> "Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."
 Similarly, with while loops, we have to see the condition for ourselves and keep looping until it's no longer true!

While loops are useful when we don't know exactly how many times we need to repeat a block of code, but we do know the condition that needs to be met in order to stop. They can also be used in conjunction with user input to keep prompting the user until they enter a valid response.
