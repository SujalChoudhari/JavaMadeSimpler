# Data Types in Java

Hello there, budding Java explorer! 🌟 Let's dive into the exciting world of data types in Java. Don't worry, I'll make it super fun and easy to understand! 🚀

In Java, data types determine the kind of data that can be stored in a variable. They help the computer understand how to handle and manipulate the data. Think of data types as different flavors of ice cream 🍦—each one has its unique characteristics and uses!


## Overview of Primitive Data Types and Strings
Here are some common data types in Java along with relatable examples:

1. **Integer**: This data type represents whole numbers without any decimal points. It's like counting your favorite candies 🍬. For example:

   ```java
   int numberOfCandies = 10;
   ```

2. **Floating-Point**: This data type represents numbers with decimal points. It's like measuring the ingredients for a recipe 🧁. For example:

   ```java
   double pi = 3.14159;
   ```

3. **Character**: This data type represents single characters, such as letters, digits, or symbols. It's like choosing your favorite emoji 😄. For example:

   ```java
   char grade = 'A';
   ```

4. **Boolean**: This data type represents true or false values. It's like answering a yes/no question 🤔. For example:

   ```java
   boolean isJavaFun = true;
   ```

5. **String**: This data type represents a sequence of characters (text). It's like writing a sentence or a message ✍️. For example:
   ```java
   String greeting = "Hello, Java Explorer!";
   ```

These examples show how different data types are used to store various kinds of information. Just like using the right tool for the right job, choosing the appropriate data type ensures efficient storage and manipulation of data.

## DIY: Your Turn! 🎉

Create a integer variable named `numberOfCandies` and assign it `10`.
Create a double variable named `pi` and assign it `3.14159`.
Now Print the value of `numberOfCandies` and `pi` to the screen.
