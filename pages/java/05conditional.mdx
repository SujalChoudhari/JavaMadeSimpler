## If Java is Fun, Learn More! 🤩

Ah, conditions in Java! 🌧️ They are like the weather forecast for your code.
Conditions help you make decisions based on certain situations.
In Java, you can use conditions to check if something is true or false, just like in mathematics.

Let's dive into some examples to understand conditions better! 😄

Suppose we have two numbers, `a` and `b`. We can use different conditions to compare them:

- Less than: `a < b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
- Equal to: `a == b`
- Not equal to: `a != b`

These conditions are like the ingredients for our decision-making recipe! 🍰

## If Statements 🚦

Now, let's see how we can use conditions in Java using "if" statements. The "if" statement allows us to execute a block of code only if a specific condition is true. 🚦

Here's the basic syntax of an "if" statement:

```java
if (condition) {
    // Code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

## Question: If Statements 🤔

<FillInTheBlanks
  questionTop="What is the output of the following code?"
  questionLeft={`
  int x = 20;
  int y = 18;
  if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("Hi");
  }
  else {
    System.out.println("Bye");
  }
  // The output is:`}
  correctAnswer="Hi"
  questionRight=""
/>

When you run this code, it will print "20 is greater than 18" because the condition inside the "if" statement is true! 🎉

You can also use variables in conditions. Let's say we have two variables, `x` and `y`, and we want to check if `x` is greater than `y`:

```java
int x = 20;
int y = 18;
if (x > y) {
    System.out.println("x is greater than y");
}
```

In this case, since `x` is indeed greater than `y`, it will print "x is greater than y". 📈

But what if the condition inside the "if" statement is false? That's where the "else" statement comes to the rescue! It allows us to specify a block of code to be executed when the condition is false. 😎

Here's an example:

```java
int time = 20;
if (time < 18) {
    System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
```

Since the value of `time` is 20, which is greater than 18, it will print "Good evening." 🌙

But wait, there's more! You can also have multiple conditions using "else if" statements. It's like having different options for different scenarios. 🌈

Here's an example that covers different times of the day:

```java
int time = 22;
if (time < 10) {
    System.out.println("Good morning.");
} else if (time < 20) {
    System.out.println("Good day.");
} else {
    System.out.println("Good evening.");
}
```

In this case, since the value of `time` is 22, it doesn't satisfy the first two conditions, but it matches the last one, so it will print "Good evening." 🌃

By using conditions, you can control the flow of your program and make it respond differently to different situations. It's like having a personal assistant for your code! 🤖💼

## DIY: If Code is Cool, Try it Yourself! 🎉

Create a variable named `mySalary` and assign it `900000`.
Create a variable named `myFriendSalary` and assign it `800000`.
If `mySalary` is greater than `myFriendSalary` print `Yay!` else print `Nay!`.
