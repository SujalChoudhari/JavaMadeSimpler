# Hello World: Say Hello to the world of Java! 🌎
Hello there, beginner Java explorer! 🌟 I'd be delighted to explain the concept of HelloWorld in Java to you. 🚀

# Why Hello World

In Java, a "HelloWorld" program is a super simple program that outputs the phrase "Hello, World!" on the screen. It serves as a common starting point for beginners to get acquainted with a new programming language. Think of it as your first step towards becoming a Java Jedi! 💪

Let's dive into an example of a Java HelloWorld program, shall we? 😄 Here's a code snippet:

```java
// Your First Program
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
}
```

Oh, don't be intimidated by the code! Let's break it down together. 🤝
Lets just start by removing things.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
  }
```

This is the main method. 
>It is the entry point of the program.   

It is the first thing that will be executed when you run your program.
We will look into it later

```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

This is the actual code that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen.
