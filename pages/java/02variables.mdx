# Variables: Store and manipulate data in Java! 📦

Welcome, aspiring Java developer! Today, let's explore the wonderful world of variables in Java. 🌟

In Java, a variable is a named storage location used to store data that can be manipulated and accessed throughout a program. It's like a labeled box where you can put different things and retrieve them later.

Let's dive into an example of how to declare and use variables in Java. 
😄 Here's a code snippet:

```java
class VariableExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Declare a variable named 'message' of type String
    String message;

    // Assign a value to the 'message' variable
    message = "Hello, Java Variables!";

    // Print the value of the 'message' variable
    System.out.println(message);
  }
}
```

Don't worry if it looks a bit overwhelming right now. Let's break it down together. 🤝

## Strings

```java
String message;
```

This line declares a variable named 'message' of type String. The 'String' keyword represents a sequence of characters. Think of it as a text-based data type.

```java
message = "Hello, Java Variables!";
```

Here, we assign the value "Hello, Java Variables!" to the 'message' variable using the assignment operator (=). This means we are storing that text in the 'message' variable.

```java
System.out.println(message);
```

Finally, we use the 'System.out.println()' statement to print the value of the 'message' variable to the screen.


## Question

<FillInTheBlanks
  questionTop='To store "Java Made Simpler" in a variable named "message" we write ...'
  questionLeft={`
class VariableExample{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    `}
  correctAnswer='String'
  questionRight={` message = "Java Made Simpler";
  }
}`}

## DIY: Your Turn! 🎉

Now it's time for you to practice with variables. Declare a variable named 'number' of type `int` and assign it a value of 42. Then, print the value of the 'number' variable to the screen.
